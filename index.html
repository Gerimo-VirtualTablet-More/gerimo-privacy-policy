  <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
  <p>
    This privacy policy applies to the Gerimo – Draw &amp; AI Shortcuts app
    (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created
    by AntozStudios (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Commercial
    service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>General Data Collection</strong>
  <p>
    The Application itself does not collect, store, or process any personally
    identifiable information (PII) about you on its own servers. The
    Application does not create user accounts and does not maintain any
    centralized databases with user content or usage profiles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any data that is processed by the Application (for example, your drawings,
    settings, and shortcut configurations) remains on your device unless you
    explicitly export or back it up using third‑party services outside the
    control of the Service Provider.
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>Device Information and Analytics</strong>
  <p>
    The Application is designed to function without collecting analytics or
    telemetry data from within the app itself. However, standard information
    such as install statistics, crash reports, and basic technical details
    (for example device model, operating system version, country) may be
    made available to the Service Provider by the app store or operating
    system provider (e.g. Google Play) according to their own terms and
    privacy policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Service Provider does not combine this information with any additional
    data to create individual user profiles and does not use it to personally
    identify you.
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>Location Information</strong>
  <p>
    The Application does not request or collect precise location data (such as
    GPS coordinates) from your mobile device.
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>Optional OpenRouter API Key and AI Features</strong>
  <p>
    The Application offers optional AI‑related features that rely on external
    AI services provided via OpenRouter. To use these optional AI features,
    you may choose to provide your own OpenRouter API key. Supplying an API
    key is completely voluntary; the core drawing functionality of the
    Application can be used without providing an API key.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your OpenRouter API key is entered directly by you within the Application
    and is stored only locally on your device (for example in the app’s local
    storage or encrypted preferences). The Service Provider does not have
    access to your API key, does not transmit it to any server controlled by
    the Service Provider, and does not store it externally.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you use the AI features, the prompts, drawings, or other content you
    send via the AI functionality are transmitted directly from your device to
    the OpenRouter service (and the underlying model providers) using your
    own API key. These requests are processed according to OpenRouter’s and
    the respective model providers’ privacy policies and terms of use, which
    are independent from this Privacy Policy and are not controlled by the
    Service Provider.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are responsible for reviewing and accepting the privacy policy and
    terms of OpenRouter and any selected model provider before using the AI
    features, especially when submitting sensitive or personal information.
    If you do not agree with those terms, you should not use the AI
    functionality or should refrain from entering such information.
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>Third‑Party Services</strong>
  <p>
    The Application itself does not integrate third‑party analytics, tracking
    SDKs, or advertising SDKs. Any data collection that may occur via the app
    store (e.g. Google Play) or via OpenRouter and its model providers is
    governed by the respective third‑party privacy policies and terms of
    service, and is outside the control of the Service Provider.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Service Provider does not sell, rent, or otherwise transfer your
    personal information to third parties.
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>Communication with You</strong>
  <p>
    The Service Provider may use contact information that you provide
    voluntarily (for example, when you send an email to the Service Provider)
    to respond to your inquiries, provide support, or send you important
    information about the Application. Such correspondence is handled
    through the email service you choose to use and is not initiated by the
    Application itself.
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>Opt‑Out Rights</strong>
  <p>
    You can stop all use of the Application at any time by uninstalling it.
    You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your
    mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you no longer want to use the AI features with OpenRouter, you can
    simply remove or reset your API key in the Application (if such an option
    is provided) or stop using the AI‑related functionality.
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>Data Retention Policy</strong>
  <p>
    Because the Application does not collect or store your personal data on
    servers controlled by the Service Provider, there is no central user data
    to retain or delete. Data such as your drawings, settings, and any locally
    stored OpenRouter API key remain on your device until you delete the
    Application or clear the app’s data using your device settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you contact the Service Provider by email and share personal
    information within that correspondence, such information may be retained
    for as long as necessary to handle your request and for a reasonable time
    thereafter, unless you request deletion where applicable.
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>Children</strong>
  <p>
    The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable
    information from children. The Application is not directed toward
    children under the age of 13, and the Service Provider does not use the
    Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under
    the age of 13.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are a parent or guardian and believe that a child has provided
    personally identifiable information to the Service Provider, please
    contact the Service Provider at hauptkonto.matteo@gmail.com so that the
    necessary actions can be taken. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may
    need to be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your
    personally identifiable information; in some countries, your parent or
    guardian may need to provide such consent on your behalf.
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>Security</strong>
  <p>
    The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality
    of your information. Although the Application itself does not store
    personal data on the Service Provider’s servers, reasonable technical and
    organizational measures are taken to protect any information that may be
    received via email or other communication channels from unauthorized
    access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of
    electronic storage is 100% secure, and the Service Provider cannot
    guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>Changes</strong>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The
    Service Provider will notify you of any changes to this Privacy Policy by
    updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to review
    this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes, as continued use of the
    Application is deemed acceptance of all changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy is effective as of 2025-11-21.
  </p>

  <br>


  <strong>Commercial Use and Model Selection Disclaimer:</strong>
	<p>
The Application only provides a technical interface to use any AI model available through OpenRouter. The selection and usage of models—including their use for commercial purposes—are the sole responsibility of the user. Please verify that your selected model is licensed and permitted for your intended use case, especially for commercial applications. The Service Provider is not responsible for any license violations or misuse of AI models by the user.
</p>


  <strong>Your Consent</strong>
  <p>
    By using the Application, you consent to the processing of information as
    described in this Privacy Policy, now and as amended by the Service
    Provider from time to time.
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>Contact Us</strong>
  <p>
    If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application,
