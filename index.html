  <title>Privacy Policy - Gerimo</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    This privacy policy applies to the Gerimo app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by AntozStudios (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Commercial service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
  </p>

  <h2>General Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    The Application itself does not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII) about you on its own servers. The Application does not create user accounts and does not maintain any centralized databases with user content or usage profiles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any data that is processed by the Application (for example, your drawings, settings, and shortcut configurations) remains on your device unless you explicitly export or back it up using third-party services outside the control of the Service Provider.
  </p>

  <h2>Device Information and Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    The Application is designed to function without collecting analytics or telemetry data from within the app itself. However, standard information such as install statistics, crash reports, and basic technical details (for example device model, operating system version, country) may be made available to the Service Provider by the app store or operating system provider (e.g. Google Play) according to their own terms and privacy policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Service Provider does not combine this information with any additional data to create individual user profiles and does not use it to personally identify you.
  </p>

  <h2>Location Information</h2>
  <p>
    The Application does not request or collect precise location data (such as GPS coordinates) from your mobile device. However, please note that approximate location data may be used by our advertising partner (Google AdMob) to serve location-relevant ads, as described in the Advertising section below.
  </p>

  <h2>Optional OpenRouter API Key and AI Features</h2>
  <p>
    The Application offers optional AI-related features that rely on external AI services provided via OpenRouter. To use these optional AI features, you may choose to provide your own OpenRouter API key. Supplying an API key is completely voluntary; the core drawing functionality of the Application can be used without providing an API key.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your OpenRouter API key is entered directly by you within the Application and is stored only locally on your device (for example in the app's local storage or encrypted preferences). The Service Provider does not have access to your API key, does not transmit it to any server controlled by the Service Provider, and does not store it externally.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you use the AI features, the prompts, drawings, or other content you send via the AI functionality are transmitted directly from your device to the OpenRouter service (and the underlying model providers) using your own API key. These requests are processed according to OpenRouter's and the respective model providers' privacy policies and terms of use, which are independent from this Privacy Policy and are not controlled by the Service Provider.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are responsible for reviewing and accepting the privacy policy and terms of OpenRouter and any selected model provider before using the AI features, especially when submitting sensitive or personal information. If you do not agree with those terms, you should not use the AI functionality or should refrain from entering such information.
  </p>

  <h2>Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    This Application uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob is an advertising service provided by Google LLC.
  </p>
  <p>
    To serve ads that are relevant to you, AdMob and its partners may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about your device and your activity within this Application and other apps.
  </p>
  <p>Data collected by AdMob may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mobile Advertising ID (Google Advertising ID on Android)</li>
    <li>Device information (device type, model, operating system, language settings)</li>
    <li>Approximate location data (if available) to serve location-based ads</li>
    <li>Usage data (information about how you interact with ads, e.g. clicks and impressions)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom, the Service Provider requests your consent before displaying personalized ads, in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Google's EU User Consent Policy. A consent prompt will be shown on first launch of the Application.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Opt-Out of Personalized Advertising:</strong></p>
  <p>
    You can opt out of personalized advertising at any time by adjusting your device settings:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Android: Go to Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads and enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization" or "Delete advertising ID".</li>
  </ul>
  <p>

    </a>
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The Application integrates Google AdMob as an advertising SDK. Additionally, any data collection that may occur via the app store (e.g. Google Play) or via OpenRouter and its model providers is governed by the respective third-party privacy policies and terms of service, and is outside the control of the Service Provider.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Service Provider does not sell, rent, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Communication with You</h2>
  <p>
    The Service Provider may use contact information that you provide voluntarily (for example, when you send an email to the Service Provider) to respond to your inquiries, provide support, or send you important information about the Application. Such correspondence is handled through the email service you choose to use and is not initiated by the Application itself.
  </p>

  <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You can stop all use of the Application at any time by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you no longer want to use the AI features with OpenRouter, you can simply remove or reset your API key in the Application (if such an option is provided) or stop using the AI-related functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Because the Application does not collect or store your personal data on servers controlled by the Service Provider, there is no central user data to retain or delete. Data such as your drawings, settings, and any locally stored OpenRouter API key remain on your device until you delete the Application or clear the app's data using your device settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you contact the Service Provider by email and share personal information within that correspondence, such information may be retained for as long as necessary to handle your request and for a reasonable time thereafter, unless you request deletion where applicable.
  </p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>
    The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Application is not directed toward children under the age of 13, and the Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are a parent or guardian and believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider, please contact the Service Provider at
    <a href="mailto:hauptkonto.matteo@gmail.com">hauptkonto.matteo@gmail.com</a>
    so that the necessary actions can be taken. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may need to be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information; in some countries, your parent or guardian may need to provide such consent on your behalf.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. Although the Application itself does not store personal data on the Service Provider's servers, reasonable technical and organizational measures are taken to protect any information that may be received via email or other communication channels from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and the Service Provider cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to this Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes, as continued use of the Application is deemed acceptance of all changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy is effective as of 2026-02-19.
  </p>

  <h2>Commercial Use and Model Selection Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    The Application only provides a technical interface to use any AI model available through OpenRouter. The selection and usage of models—including their use for commercial purposes—are the sole responsibility of the user. Please verify that your selected model is licensed and permitted for your intended use case, especially for commercial applications. The Service Provider is not responsible for any license violations or misuse of AI models by the user.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Consent</h2>
  <p>
    By using the Application, you consent to the processing of information as described in this Privacy Policy, now and as amended by the Service Provider from time to time.
  </p>
